## Available Scripts

After cloning the repo, please run `npm i` and `npm start` to start the dev server.

# I have not used any code generators for this test, every page is written by me from 0 tp 10

# I went with React, typescript as suggested

# Extras:

I have added Material UI library for UI optimizaton and to use components like checkbox, Pagination etc..

I also improved the UI UX of the page

# What would you have done if you had more time?

I would have made pagination and other filters as query params and use the url to extract the data so thet even after the page refresh. same result is shown. This also helps users to share the URL which gives same result

I would have added search functionality to the top of the page
